# KG-IQA: Knowledge-Guided Blind Image Quality Assessment with Few Training Samples
This is the source code for 'KG-IQA: Knowledge-Guided Blind Image Quality Assessment with Few Training Samples'(doi:10.1109/TMM.2022.3233244).

For test:
1. Data Prepareation
   To ensure high speed, save images and lables of each dataset with 'mat' files. Only need to run once.
2. Load pre-trained weight for test.
   The models pre-trained on KonIQ-10k with 5%,10%,25%,80% samples are released, and each released model are obtained from the first split ().
